# PyPoll Election Analysis Challenge

## Overview of Election Audit
Our team was assigned to aid the Colorado Board Of Elections employees in creating an election audit for the results of the U.S. congressional precinct election in Colorado. One of the employees asked our team to create an audit that presented the results of the congressional election. More specifically the congressional precinct in Colorado wanted to see the total number of votes, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the majority vote. To automate the process for the employees, we utilized Python to gather and create a vote count report to present the election results. After gathering the initial results of the election data, the precinct asked our team to gather additional information for the audit. We were asked to collect the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the county with the largest turnout. 

## Election-Audit Results
After gathering the additional election data, our team successfully captured the results and created the election audit. Presented Below are the outcome of the election results:

  * Total Votes Casted in the congressional election: 369,711
  
  * Total number of votes and percentage of total number of votes per county: 
      * Jefferson county: 10.5% of total votes, 38,855 total votes
      * Denver county: 82.8% of total votes, 306,055 total votes
      * Arapahoe: 6.7% of total votes, 24,801 total votes
      
  * County with the largest number of votes: Denver, 306,055 total votes 
      
 * Total number of votes and the percentage of the total number of votes per candidate:
    * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% of total number, 85,213 total votes
    * Diana DeGette: 73.8% of total votes, 272,892 total votes
    * Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% of total votes, 11,606 total votes
    
 * Candidate with the largest number of votes: Diana DeGette, 272,892 total votes, 73.8% of total votes
 
## Election-Audit Summary
  The results of the election analysis revealed that Diana DeGette won the congressional election with 272,892 votes and made up 73.8% of the total vote. Additionally, Denver county had the largest number of votes with a total of 306,055. 
   Although the election audit was created to help discover election results for the congressional election in Colorado, it can be manipulated to accommodate other election types in different scenarios. For example, the code can be used to determine local election results in a small town. The code can also be used to determine the election results for small scale projects such as a student body council in high school. Also, the code could even be used to determine the general election if adapted to a large scale. The election audit solutions can be manipulated in many ways and will hopefully be helpful to many other elections in the future.
